<h3 align="center"><b>The Resurrection Stone is one of the fabled Deathly Hallows.<br>
In "The Tale of the Three Brothers", it was the second Hallow created, <br>
supposedly by Death himself. It was bestowed upon Cadmus Peverell after he requested, <br>
as his bounty, something with the power to recall loved ones from Death. <br>
According to legend, whoever reunited it with the <br>
other two Hallows (the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility) <br>
would become the Master of Death.<br><br>

It was one of the two Hallows known to have been successfully passed down <br>
from generation to generation since Cadmus' time. In 1943 it passed to <br>
the possession of Tom Riddle who unknowingly stole it while it was still <br>
concealed in Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which he turned into a Horcrux. <br>
The ring was destroyed in 1996 by Albus Dumbledore, but the stone <br>
was placed in Harry Potter's first Golden Snitch until it passed <br>
into the possession of Harry Potter who used it to great <br>
success in the Second Wizarding War.
