<h3 align="center"><b>Three brothers, travelling along a lonely,<br> winding road at 
twilight reached a deep treacherous river where anyone who attempted to swim or wade 
would drown. <br>Learned in the magical arts, the brothers conjured a bridge with 
their wands and proceed to cross.<br><br>


Halfway though the bridge, a hooded figure stood before them. <br>
The figure was the enraged spirit of Death, cheated of his due.<br>
Death cunningly pretended to congratulate 
them and proceeds to award them with gifts of their own choosing.<br><br>

The eldest brother, a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.<br> 
Death granted his wish by fashioning the Elder Wand from a branch of a nearby elder tree <br>
standing on the banks of the river. The second brother, an arrogant man, <br>
chose to further humiliate death, and asked for the power to recall the 
deceased from the grave.<br> Death granted his wish by crafting the 
Resurrection Stone from a stone picked from the riverbank. <br>The third and youngest brother, 
who was the most humble and wise, <br>did not trust Death and asked for something to 
enable him to go forth without Death being able to follow.<br> A reluctant Death, 
most unwillingly, handed over his own Invisibility cloak.<br><br>

The three brothers took their prizes and soon went on their separate ways.<br><br>

The eldest brother travelled to a village where a wizard whom he had quarrelled lived. <br>
He sought out a duel and fought the wizard using the wand, instantly killing the latter.<br>
Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the eldest brother walked to an inn not far from 
the duelling site and spent the night there. <br>Taken by his conscience and 
lust of the Elder Wand's power, <br>the eldest brother boasted of this wand gifted 
by Death and his own invincibility.<br>
That very night, Death transfigured to a murderous wizard. <br>
The unknown murderous wizard crept to the inn as the eldest brother slept, <br>
drunk from wine. The wizard slit the oldest brotherâ€™s throat 
for good measure and stole the wand. <br>That was when Death took the first brother.<br><br>


The second brother returned to his home where he lived alone. <br>
Turning the stone thrice in his hand the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry,<br> 
before her untimely death, appeared at once before him, much to his delight. <br>
Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. <br>
Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. <br>
Finally, the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, <br>
committed suicide by hanging from his house' balcony so as truly to join her. <br>
That was when Death took the second brother for his own.<br><br>

Death searched for the youngest brother as years passed but never succeeded.<br>
It was only when the third brother reached a great age, <br>
he took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. <br>
Greeting Death as an old friend, they departed this life as equals.
