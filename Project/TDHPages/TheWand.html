<h3 align="center"><b>The Elder Wand is one of three objects that make up the fabled Deathly Hallows.<br> 
According to "The Tale of the Three Brothers", it was the first Hallow created, <br>
supposedly by Death himself. It was bestowed upon Antioch Peverell after he requested, <br>
as his bounty, a wand worthy of someone who had outsmarted Death. According to legend, <br>
whoever united the wand with the other two Hallows<br> (the Resurrection Stone 
and the Cloak of Invisibility) <br>would become the Master of Death.<br>

It is said to be the most powerful wand that has ever existed, able to perform <br>
feats of magic that would normally be impossible even for the most skilled wizards,<br> 
such as mending another wand damaged beyond normal magical repair. <br>
The Elder Wand's core is the tail hair of a Thestral, a potent yet tricky substance <br>
to master; only a witch or wizard who is capable of accepting death can do so, since <br>
only by them can a Thestral hair even be seen
