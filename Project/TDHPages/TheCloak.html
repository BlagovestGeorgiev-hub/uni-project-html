<h3 align="center"><b>The Cloak of Invisibility is a magical artefact used to render the wearer invisible,<br>
 and one of the fabled Deathly Hallows. In "The Tale of the Three Brothers",<br> it was the
 third and final Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself (whom had the cloak in his
 possession at that time),<br> and bestowed upon Ignotus Peverell after he requested,<br>
 as his bounty, for something with the power to hide him if he were to go place to
 place without being followed by Death.<br> According to legend, whoever united it with 
 the other two Hallows<br> (the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone)<br> would become the 
 Master of Death.<br><br>

This invisibility cloak was the only known one that would not fade with age and 
would provide everlasting protection to the wearer,<br> something no normal invisibility
 cloak could provide. As such,<br> it was the only Hallow known to have been successfully
 passed down from generation to generation since Ignotus' time.<br> In 1991, it passed to
 the possession of Harry Potter<br> who used it to
 great success in the Second Wizarding War and resolved to pass it down to his
 own children.</b></p>
